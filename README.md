# stage_2-task

1. Write a function for translating DNA to protein
2a. Write a function that simulates and generates a logistic population growth curve. Your function should include 2 extra parameters that randomize the length of the lag phase and the exponential phase. Therefore, your growth curve can be: Population Size vs Time, Cell density vs Time, OD vs Time, CFU vs Time, etc
2b. Using your function, generate a dataframe with 100 different growth curves
3. Write a function for determining the time to reach 80% of the maximum growth; usually the carrying capacity
4. Write a function for calculating the hamming distance between your Slack username and twitter/X handle
